# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 2, 2016
**Today's Progress:** I begun work on the Free Code Camp's basic front end development projects.  I whipped up a quick tribute page to Hideo Kojima and I started to work on building a personal portfolio webpage.

**Thoughts:** I'm pretty excited about working on a personal portfolio webpage.  This is a project I've been wanting to implement and now I finally have the motivation to get it done.
